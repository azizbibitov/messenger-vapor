# Task ID: 40
# Title: Continuous Deployment & Database Migrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for the backend to enable continuous deployment after each iteration, and implement a database migration strategy for schema changes.
# Details:
Automate build, test, and deployment process for the Vapor backend (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Render/Railway built-in CI). Implement database migration tools (e.g., Fluent migrations in Vapor) to handle schema evolution between iterations without data loss.

# Test Strategy:
Perform a dummy schema change and verify successful deployment and migration on staging, ensure no downtime during deployment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select CI/CD Platform & Migration Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate available CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions, Render/Railway built-in CI) and confirm the suitability of Vapor's Fluent migrations for schema evolution. Select the primary tools for the pipeline and migration strategy.
### Details:
Research integration capabilities with existing deployment infrastructure (from Task 32). Document pros and cons of chosen platforms. Confirm Fluent's capabilities for non-destructive migrations and its compatibility with the chosen database (PostgreSQL).

## 2. Implement Initial Database Migration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Vapor's Fluent migration framework into the backend project. Create a basic, non-destructive migration (e.g., adding a new column to an existing table or a dummy table) to verify the setup.
### Details:
Add Fluent package to the Vapor project, configure database connection for migrations, create a simple 'Migration' class (e.g., 'AddDummyTable' or 'AddUserStatusColumn'), and ensure it can be run locally via 'vapor migrate'.

## 3. Configure CI/CD for Automated Build and Test [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the chosen CI/CD platform to automatically build the Vapor backend project and execute all defined tests (unit, integration) upon code pushes or pull requests.
### Details:
Create CI/CD workflow files (e.g., '.github/workflows/ci.yml' for GitHub Actions). Define steps for checking out code, installing Vapor dependencies, building the project, and running 'vapor test'. Ensure environment variables required for testing are securely configured.

## 4. Integrate Database Migrations into CI/CD Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3
### Description: Modify the CI/CD pipeline to automatically apply database migrations to the staging environment before or as part of the application deployment process.
### Details:
Add a step in the CI/CD workflow to execute 'vapor migrate' or an equivalent command against the staging database. Ensure the CI/CD environment has the necessary database credentials and connectivity to the staging database. Consider strategies for handling failed migrations or rollbacks.

## 5. Implement Automated Deployment to Staging [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the successfully built and tested Vapor backend application, along with applied migrations, to the staging environment.
### Details:
Define the deployment steps in the CI/CD workflow, utilizing the chosen hosting provider's deployment mechanisms (e.g., Render/Railway built-in deployment, Docker image push and deployment). Ensure environment variables for the staging environment are correctly configured and securely passed. Verify application startup and basic API access post-deployment.
