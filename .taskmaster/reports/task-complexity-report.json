			"taskId": 36,
			"taskTitle": "Delivery & Read Receipts Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Delivery & Read Receipts Implementation' into 6 detailed subtasks, covering backend database extension, backend logic for delivered/read statuses, iOS UI indicator implementation, and sending read events.",
			"reasoning": "This task extends existing functionality, requiring database schema modifications, new backend logic for tracking delivery and read states, and corresponding UI updates and event sending on the iOS client. It's an enhancement rather than a core new feature."

			"taskId": 37,
			"taskTitle": "Push Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Push Notification System' into 8 detailed subtasks, covering backend device token management, APNs sending logic, iOS push notification registration, token submission, and handling incoming notifications in different app states.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex integration with Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), requiring careful handling of certificates/keys on the backend, managing device tokens, and implementing robust logic for sending notifications. On iOS, it involves registration, token management, and handling notifications in various app states."

			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "User Presence Feature",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'User Presence Feature' into 6 detailed subtasks, covering backend WebSocket connection tracking, presence event broadcasting, iOS client listening for presence, and real-time UI updates for user status.",
			"reasoning": "This task extends the existing WebSocket functionality to track user presence, requiring backend logic for managing connection states and broadcasting updates, and corresponding real-time UI updates on the iOS client. While building on existing WS, it adds new state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 39,
			"taskTitle": "Offline Sync Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Offline Sync Mechanism' into 6 detailed subtasks, covering backend sync endpoint implementation, iOS logic for determining sync timestamp, API call for sync, and robust merging of messages into the local database.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a new backend endpoint for fetching historical data and complex client-side logic to intelligently merge fetched messages into the local database, ensuring data consistency and avoiding duplicates after periods of being offline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 40,
			"taskTitle": "Continuous Deployment & Database Migrations",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Continuous Deployment & Database Migrations' into 7 detailed subtasks, covering CI/CD tool selection, build/test/deployment automation, and setting up a robust database migration strategy for schema evolution.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a critical CI/CD pipeline, which requires scripting, environment configuration, and integration with hosting providers. Additionally, implementing a robust database migration strategy is crucial for schema evolution and preventing data loss, adding another layer of complexity."
